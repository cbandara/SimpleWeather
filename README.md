Summary:
SimpleWeather is an app that allows users to check the real time weather conditions in their area. Users are prompted to enter their zip code. The application takes the users zip code and runs it through an api that returns a set of coordinates for the zip code. These coordinates are given to the Dark Sky weather API. Using this API the application shows users the cloud cover, temperature, humidity, dew point, wind speed and precipitation. Users can press the back button to go back to the home page and enter a different zip code.

To Do: Add an error response if the user input is not a valid zip code
